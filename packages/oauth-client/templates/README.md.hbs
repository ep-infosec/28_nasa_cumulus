# @cumulus/oauth-client

Utilities for OAuth authentication using
[NASA Earthdata Login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/) and [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/).

## Versioning

Cumulus uses a modified semantic versioning scheme and minor releases likely
include breaking changes.

Before upgrade, please read the Cumulus
[release notes](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus/releases) before upgraded.

It is strongly recommended you do not use `^` in your `package.json` to
automatically update to new minor versions. Instead, pin the version or use `~`
to automatically update to new patch versions.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @cumulus/oauth-client
```

## Class Structure

This package contains a generic, parent class called `OAuthClient`. This class has a few common methods
like `oAuthClient.getAuthorizationUrl()` which are used by all classes that inherit from `OAuthClient`.

The examples below document these common methods as well as methods specific to the child classes, e.g.
`cognitoClient.getUserInfo(accessToken)`.

## Earthdata Login Usage Example

```js
const { EarthdataLoginClient } = require('@cumulus/oauth-client');

const client = new EarthdataLogin({
  clientId: 'my-client-id',
  clientPassword: 'my-client-password',
  loginUrl: 'https://earthdata.login.nasa.gov',
  redirectUri: 'http://my-api.com'
});
```
## Cognito Usage Example

```js
const { CognitoClient } = require('@cumulus/oauth-client');

const client = new CognitoClient({
  clientId: 'my-client-id',
  clientPassword: 'my-client-password',
  loginUrl: 'https://auth.csdap.sit.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/',
  redirectUri: 'http://my-api.com'
});
```
